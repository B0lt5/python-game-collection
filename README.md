# Python GUI Games Collection ðŸŽ®

This is a collection of classic text-based games implemented with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Python's built-in **Tkinter** library.

The application uses a multi-frame structure, allowing users to easily switch between games from a central **Main Menu**.

## Features

* **Main Menu:** A central hub to select any of the implemented games.
* **Modular Design:** Each game is contained within its own `tk.Frame` class for clean separation of logic and GUI.
* **External Data Loading:** Games like Word Guessing (Hangman) and the Quiz Game load their data from external JSON files, making them easy to update.
